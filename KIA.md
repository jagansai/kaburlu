It was somewhere in 2016, when a Korean company, KIA, was going through the    
policy of "Make In India" that was thought through during Manmohan Singh govt,   
but never told public about it.

Hyndai, a parent company of KIA motors, already has a manufacturing unit setup 
in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.    
It is natural that they wanted to setup KIA motors in a neighbouring state of 
Telangana.

Also, the charming and English-speaking IT minister of Telangana,Mr. KTR,is very   
much interested in setting up a car manufacturing unit in Telangana.
Then, came Naidu. He told the KIA representatives that Modi loves him a lot.   
Good that Koreas are not like Americans.Otherwise, this would have given a different meaning altogether.   

Naidu continued his pitch to that Korean rep and even boasted a bit by saying that,
Modi even gave a special status to AP so that any manufacturing unit that's setup in AP do not need to pay any tax.   
KIA executives got ecstatic and showed interest in setting up the unit in AP.
Then came the bad news. 
Modi denied special status to AP.
But, by then KIA did their homework and learnt about Naiduâ€™s greatness.
They said f**k it, we will setup a unit in AP, no matter what.    

That hurt Modi's ego.He ordered KIA to move the unit to Guj.   
The Korean rep asked Modi, "Aap ka naam kya hai?".    
Of course, in Korean though.This made Modi even more butthurt.
He ordered his secretaries to make Special package ( alternative to Special Status ) more complicated by introducing words like "Special Purpose Vehicle".
There was disappointment among every well-wisher of AP.    

Of course, Naidu got disappointed the most.He allegedly threw away PM post for AP 
CM post.   
The BIL of Naidu, Balakrishna, told him that such "special purpose vehicles" are only
found in his father's folk movies.
But Naidu is a techie guy. 
**He found the solution by himself.** After all, KIA is a vehicle manufacturing company. **Can't they make special purpose vehicles?**   

He quickly thanked his favourite, *"One True God"** and made his deals with KIA reps,much more aggressively.   

**The result, GOI with their gibberish language, introduced special package to AP in 2016.
KIA with their inclination to AP and with the commitment of Naidu, finally invested a car manufacturing unit in AP in April 2017.***
